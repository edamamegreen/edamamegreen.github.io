<p>I don't know about you but there are some music/dance videos that inspire such embarrassing feelings of happiness and love that I question my agnosticism. When I am feeling bummed, watching one of my favorite music videos will turn me around. And possibly waste an hour on YouTube.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMeyvg1M52k">Ici &amp; Maintenant by Yelle on YouTube</a></p>
<figure style="max-width: 555px"><img src="yelle.png" /></figure><p>My latest favorite is Yelle's Ici &amp; Maintenant (Here &amp; Now) and it's destined to stay at the top of my list for a long time. The video fulfills my basic criteria for a good video:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it tells a fun story,</li>
  <li>it makes the most of mood in the music,</li>
  <li>the dancing makes me want to dance, too, and</li>
  <li>it doesn't have characters who are depressed, cruel, or only sexual.</li>
</ul>

<p>What takes this video to awesome-as-space level is that it is playful, inclusive art. The team that created this video took an odd idea, a relationship in which one person is always moving spastically, and they delved into the absurdity. Who are these people? Why is one always moving? Are they in a relationship? What kind of relationship?</p>

<p>As I watch, I go from being curious and amused to becoming attached to this endearing couple and the mystery of their lives. And at the end, I'm rewarded with a fun surprise - a final clue that extends the mystery. Did they switch places at midnight? What does that mean?</p>

<p>I don't know French so perhaps understanding the lyrics might change my opinion. The Google translate version of the lyrics doesn't seem unexpected or inappropriate so I'll stick to my opinion: I absolutely love it and I'll probably be happier and more creative if I watch it every morning.</p>

<p>Hope you like it, too!</p>
