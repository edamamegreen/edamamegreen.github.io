</div><div class="date"><p>July 17, 2017</p>
</div><div class="postBody"><p>My partner is interested in woodworking but seemed to be delayed getting started so I challenged him to build four sitting stools over the month of July.</p>

<p>I choose the number four because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You've got to make more than one of something to get good at making it.</li>
  <li>A week per sitting stool seemed reasonable for planning and execution.</li>
  <li>Sitting stools can be simple to build but the possibilities are great and they don't need to be as structurally sound as a step stool.</li>
</ul>
<figure style="max-width: 555px"><img src="vietnam.jpg" /><figcaption>The stools we saw in Vietnam really kicked off our interest. Little sidewalk restaurants use them to set out a dining area while open and stack them away after closing.</figcaption></figure><p>I'm making some sitting stools, too. My interest is stools that can be stacked easily and I found many great ideas on Pinterest. I was most impressed with a design that stacked horizontally instead of vertically.</p>
<figure style="max-width: 555px"><img src="aa-stools.jpeg" /><figcaption>AA Stools by Torafu Architects</figcaption></figure><p>I read about them a bit in this <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2012/12/16/aa-stools-by-torafu-architects/">Dezeen article</a>. The website for Torafu Architects is <a href="http://torafu.com/">www.torafu.com</a>. There is a nice story about how the architects designed this as a joint project with a community workshop established after the tsunami.</p>

<p>These seemed simple enough for me to make. My partner created some drawings for them, making up an angle for the legs.</p>
<figure style="max-width: 555px"><img src="my-stools.jpg" /><figcaption>These came pretty close! A bit of a mishap in the heights.</figcaption></figure><p>Before I go further, I want to say that TOOL LIBRARIES ARE AWESOME! We were able to borrow this great miter saw in the photo and it was so helpful.</p>

<p>Making thing is hard! The photo hides a lot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gaps between the wood because I didn't clamp them together while screwing in the screws</li>
  <li>accidentally screwing in on the outside instead of the inside of the legs</li>
  <li>an extra screw on the top to try and reduce wiggle</li>
</ul>

<p>I took one apart and pretty much redid the whole thing. I made 3 of these so that knocked out most of the month's requirement. ;)</p>
